#  Task 1 — Nmap Casestudy (Port Scanning)

Author: Vancha Likhith Bharadwaj Reddy
Date: 22 September 2025

##  Task Overview

This Day 1 hands-on project demonstrates practical port-scanning exercises using Nmap. You’ll learn how to discover open ports, identify services running on those ports, and interpret scan results — fundamental skills for anyone exploring cybersecurity and network reconnaissance.

##  Repository Structure
port-scan-task1
- 10.204.198.122.gnmap -Saved .gnmap results
- 10.204.198.122.nmap  -Saved .nmap results
- 10.204.198.122.xml   -Saved .xml results
- README.md            -Project summary and instructions
- analysis.md          -Detailed Day 1 report with findings and insights

##  Tools & Technologies

Nmap — network discovery and security auditing

Command Prompt / PowerShell — running scans on Windows

Wireshark / TShark (optional) — packet capture and analysis

##  Key Highlights

Performed basic and targeted port scans using Nmap.

Collected and interpreted Nmap output files (text, XML, grepable).

Captured optional packet data for deeper analysis (Wireshark/TShark).

Documented findings, risks, and remediation suggestions in a clear report.

Organized outputs and commands to make the repository reproducible and shareable.

##  How to use this repo

Read  README.md for setup and safety notes.

Open analysis.md for the full Day 1 writeup and interpretation of results.

Inspect saved scan results. Redact any sensitive data before publishing.

## ⚠️ Safety & Ethics

Only scan systems and networks you own or for which you have explicit permission. Packet captures and scan outputs may contain sensitive information — sanitize before sharing publicly.
