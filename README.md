#  Task 1 — Nmap Casestudy (Port Scanning)

Author: Vancha Likhith Bharadwaj Reddy
Date: 22 September 2025

## 🌟 Task Overview

This Day 1 hands-on project demonstrates practical port-scanning exercises using Nmap. You’ll learn how to discover open ports, identify services running on those ports, and interpret scan results — fundamental skills for anyone exploring cybersecurity and network reconnaissance.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
port-scan-task1/
- analysis.md          -Detailed Day 1 report with findings and insights
- README.md            -Project summary and instructions
- outputs              -Saved Nmap outputs (.nmap, .xml, .gnmap, .txt)
- commands.txt         -Exact commands used during the exercises

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Nmap — network discovery and security auditing

Command Prompt / PowerShell — running scans on Windows

Wireshark / TShark (optional) — packet capture and analysis

## 📌 Key Highlights

Performed basic and targeted port scans using Nmap.

Collected and interpreted Nmap output files (text, XML, grepable).

Captured optional packet data for deeper analysis (Wireshark/TShark).

Documented findings, risks, and remediation suggestions in a clear report.

Organized outputs and commands to make the repository reproducible and shareable.

## 🧭 How to use this repo

Read  README.md for setup and safety notes.

Review commands.txt for the exact Nmap/TShark commands used.

Open analysis.md for the full Day 1 writeup and interpretation of results.

Inspect files in outputs/ for saved scan results. Redact any sensitive data before publishing.

## ⚠️ Safety & Ethics

Only scan systems and networks you own or for which you have explicit permission. Packet captures and scan outputs may contain sensitive information — sanitize before sharing publicly.
